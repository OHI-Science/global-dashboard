# Setup

```{r}
source("global.R")
```

# Mariculture

Code used to calculate baseline metrics based on most recent available Mariculture data.

Data Sources for Metrics:

* FAO Global Aquaculture Production Quantity 1950_2016 ([download data](http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en#downlApp))
* Watson 2018 ([paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X18300605) and [original data download](http://data.imas.utas.edu.au/portal/search?uuid=ff1274e1-c0ab-411b-a8a2-5a12eb27f2c0))

## Set Common Variables
```{r}
yr <- 2016
common_yr <- 2015 # most recent shared available fisheries and mariculture data year
```

## First Metric

Percentage contribution of mariculture to food provision (versus fisheries) using OHI tailored FAO data and Watson 2018 data. 

Note: OHI data is filtered differently for Mariculture and Fisheries, so it's difficult to compare using OHI data. Instead for this first metric, I use the FAO reported statistics for all inland aquaculture, marine aquaculture, and total seafood production by fisheries and aquaculture. FAO statistics indicate all aquaculture represents 53% of seafood production (exclude non-food uses), with caveats such as exclusion of seaweed (see [FAO SOFIA 2018 Report](http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/)). Based on the FAO SOFIA 2018 Report, mariculture represented about 36% of all aquaculture production in both 2015 and 2016 and 19% of all seafood production in 2016.

```{r}

## FAO Data from SOFIA 2018 Report: Units in Millions of Tonnes
total_aquaculture <- 80.0
mariculture <- 28.7
food_use_only <- 151.2 # total_seafood_prod <- 170.9

mariculture/food_use_only
total_aquaculture/food_use_only

## FAO statistics show that mariculture contribute about 19% to all seafood production; all aquauculture contributes 53%

```

## Second Metric

Which country contributed the most to mariculture (by tonnes) in 2016.

```{r}

allProd <- mar_harvest %>%
  filter(year == yr) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(tonnes))
top_cntry <- mar_harvest %>% 
  filter(year == yr) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(cntry_tot = sum(tonnes)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(rel_contrib = cntry_tot/allProd$total) %>% 
  arrange(desc(rel_contrib))
top_cntry$country[1]
paste(round(top_cntry$rel_contrib[1]*100),"%",sep="")

```

## Third Metric

Break down of taxa contribtution in 2016.

```{r}

fish <- mar_harvest %>% 
  filter(Taxon == "Fish", year == yr) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(tonnes))

shellfish <- mar_harvest %>% 
  filter(Taxon %in% c("Crustacean", "Bivalve and Molluscs"), year == yr) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(tonnes))

## inverts include jellyfish, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirt
invertebrate <- mar_harvest %>% 
  filter(Taxon == "Invertebrate", year == yr) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(tonnes))

algae <- mar_harvest %>% 
  filter(Taxon == "Seaweed", year == yr) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(tonnes))

## Mariculture
paste(round((algae/allProd)[[1]]*100), "%", sep = "")
paste(round((invertebrate/allProd)[[1]]*100), "%", sep = "")
paste(round((shellfish/allProd)[[1]]*100), "%", sep = "")
paste(round((fish/allProd)[[1]]*100), "%", sep = "")

```


## Extra Metric

Which country is producing the most seafood per coastal population in 2016.

```{r}
perCap <- mar_global_map %>% 
  filter(type == "prodPerCap") %>% 
  arrange(desc(map_data))
perCap$country[1]
paste(formatC(round(perCap$map_data[1]), big.mark=","), "lb pp", sep = " ")

```
