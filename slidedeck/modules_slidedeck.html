# Intro to the Global Dashboard

## How to Use this Slide Deck

The global dashboard was created to provide OHI Global users a way to explore the data that went into calculating each of the 10 goals. 

I am not going to teach you `shiny`. You can do that on your own time. What I will do is walk you through how to add a new goal section to the global dashboard. 

There are short videos at the end of each section that summarize the content if you'd rather not read.

**Feel free to skip to any of the sections 6 through 10 if you are good at hacking your way through R and know what you're trying to do.**

---

## Main components you'll be customizing

The **UI** (`ui.R`) and **server** (`server.R`) are best friends and without telling them both that you want to create something, such as a map, your map will not generate.

The **server** is where you add custom, interactive charts and maps for each goal. The **UI** is where you specify the layout and text for those elements in your dashboard.

&lt;br&gt;

To prepare your OHI goal data for map or plot visualization, open a new script in the **dataprep** folder and name it something like `fis.R` or `fisheries.R`, depending on how explicit you want to be. I would stick with the acronyms OHI uses for the goals and sub-goals, but that's just me.

To see how you would need to format your data table, check out sections [9](https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/rstudio/files/github/global-dashboard/slidedeck/modules_slidedeck.html#map) &amp; [10](https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/rstudio/files/github/global-dashboard/slidedeck/modules_slidedeck.html#chart).

## My personal definition of a shiny module..

It represents a collection of functions that can be **reused** to create the same type of shiny element over and over.

&lt;br&gt;

Each of the three shiny modules in the Global Dashboard has a 1) user interface function and a 2) server-side function:

* **Summary Statistics Card**: `summary_stats_ui( )`, `summary_stats( )`
* **Map Card**: `map_ui( )`, `card_map( )`
* **Chart Card**: `card_ui( )`, `card_plot( )`

You can find these in the **modules** folder. Each module has it's own R script, named aptly.

You will see examples of the ui and server module elements in the next two sections.


---
name: ui
class: middle, center

# Sneak Peak: User Interface

---

## There's a lot in the UI

but all the main components of each sidebar section will be specified inside `tabItems( )`

```
tabItems(
 ## Home Page ##
   tabItem(tabName = "dashboard", # unique identifier
            frontp() # content is in front_page.R
            )

 ## Mariculture ##
    tabItem(tabName = "mar", # unique identifier
          tab_title_ui(), # header UI function
          summary_stats_ui(), # summary statistics UI module
          map_ui(), # map UI module
          card_ui() # plot UI module
          )
          
)
```

---

## Notes about UI

* The UI only creates the layout, sets the text for the content, you'll need to define matching module functions in the server for the outputs to be created
* You can create as many cards, maps, baseline metrics, and title sections as you want, but I tend to avoid cluttering the shiny dashboard, so you can direct the user's attention towards specific visuals without overwhelming them
* The four different elements you just saw are created by 4 different modules. Each module has a ui function as well as a server function. Without both, you can't create the outputs you just saw in the previous slide



---
name: server
class: middle, center

# Sneak Peak: Server

---

## Server, Simplified

This is the basic code that exists in the server that communicates with the ui to generate the plot, the summary statistics, and map.

```
function(input, output, session) {

  callModule(card_plot, id),
  callModule(summary_stats, id),
  callModule(card_map, id)

}

```

---
name: sidebar
class: middle, center

# Add New Goal Section to the Sidebar

---

## First add the sidebar tab name

Function: `menuItem( )`

Currently there are only two tabs: **The OHI Story** and **Mariculture**. To create a tab section in the side bar:

* Go to **ui.R**
* Locate `sidebarMenu( )` inside `dashboardSidebar( )`
* Uncomment and edit the goal you want to add a `menuItem( )` for

Arguments: Provide the name of the tab (e.g. **"Fisheries"**) and provide a unique ID in `tabName`. This must match the `tabName` in `tabItem( )` in the next section. I'd stick with the lower-case, OHI goal abbreviations.

```
  dashboardSidebar(
    
    sidebarMenu(
       menuItem("The OHI Story", tabName = "dashboard", icon = icon("globe", lib="glyphicon")),
       menuItem("Mariculture", tabName = "mar")
      # menuItem("Tourism &amp; Recreation", tabName = "tr"),
      # menuItem("Fisheries", tabName = "fis")
      )
  )
```

.footnote[Back to [Table of Contents](https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/rstudio/files/github/global-dashboard/slidedeck/modules_slidedeck.html#3)]

---

## Now add the page for the new section

Function: `tabItem( )`

* You should still be in **ui.R**
* Go to the `tabItems( )` section
* Create a new `tabItem( )` for your goal

Arguments: The only thing you need to do is specify `tabName` with a unique ID (I would stick with the lower-case OHI abbreviations for each goal and sub-goal)

```
tabItems(

 ## Fisheries ##
    tabItem(tabName = "fis"),
    
 ## Mariculture ##
    tabItem(tabName = "mar")

)
```


---
name: header
class: middle, center

# Add Header Content

---

## Don't need a module for this one

Function: `tab_title_ui( )`

* Go to **ui.R**, `tabItems( )`, then create a `tabItem( )` section
* Type in your `goal_text`, which is just the goal name in caps
* Type in the `goal_description`, a one-liner that draws people's interest
* Type in the OHI `definition` for the goal and give a bit more context about how it's calculated. 

```
tabItems(
 ## Mariculture ##
    tabItem(tabName = "mar",
        
          ## Mariculture Tab Title ##
          tab_title_ui(goal_text = "MARICULTURE",
                       goal_description = "Global mariculture has been growing impressively since the 1980s, while wild-caught fishery production has remained relatively static.",
                       definition = list("Mariculture measures the ability to reach the highest levels of seafood gained from farm-raised facilities without damaging the oceanâ€™s ability to provide fish sustainably now and in the future. You can make this as long as you want"))
          )
)
```

---
name: stats
class: middle, center

# Add Summary Statistics Module

---

## UI Module

* Go to **ui.R**, `tabItems( )`, `tabItem( )`
* Set the `id`, the unique id for this summary statistics shiny element (Ex: "mar_stats", "fis_stats"). This must match the id for this module on the server side (see next slide)
* Set the `number_boxes`, the number of summary statistics you want to display

```
tabItems(
 ## Mariculture ##
    tabItem(tabName = "mar",
    
          ## Mariculture Baseline Metrics ##
          summary_stats_ui(id = "mar_baseline",
                               number_boxes = 3)
          )
)
```


---

## Server Module

Change `statistic` and corresponding `text` for each iteration to allow for multiple flexibility. I used the **test/summary_stats.Rmd** script to wrangle and derive the statistics for Mariculture.

```
function(input, output, session) {

## Mariculture Baseline Metrics ##
  callModule(summary_stats, "mar_baseline",
             number_boxes = 3,
             statistic = list("19%", "68%", "51%"),
             text = list("of global seafood comes from mariculture. Aquaculture, which includes marine and inland production, contributes 53% to all seafood provision.",
                         "of mariculture produced in 2016 for human consumption came from China. They are followed by South Korea at only 4%!",
                         "of mariculture is comprised of shellfish production by weight. The remaining 33% is from seaweed and 15% from fish."))

}
```

---
name: map
class: middle, center

# Add a Global Map!

---

## UI Module

For full description of arguments see **modules/map_card.R**.

* `id` is a unique ID that must match the `id` in the server side of the map code
* `select_type` options are **radio** buttons, a **drop_down** menu, or **select** buttons (you need to have " " around the select type)
* `select_location` options are **above** or **below**
* `select_choices` is a vector of the categories in the column **type**
* `source_text` is to list the source of the data

```
## Mariculture Global Map
          map_ui(id = "mar_global_map",
                 title_text = paste0("Global Map of Mariculture Production in ", data_yr),
                 sub_title_text = "Start exploring! Select different data to view on the map &amp; click on EEZ regions to see country and values (may take a few seconds to load).",
                 select_type = "radio",
                 select_location = "above",
                 select_choices = c("All Production" = "prodTonnesAll",
                                    "Production per Capita" = "prodPerCap"),
                 select_label = "",
                 source_text = list(
                   p("Sources:"),
                   p(tags$sup("1."), tags$a(href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en", "Food and Agriculture Organization"), ", Global Aquaculture Production Quantity (March 2018)"),
                   p(tags$sup("2."), tags$a(href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4/documentation","Center for International Earth Science Information Network"), ", Gridded Population of the World, V4 (2016).")
                   )
                 )
```

---

## Server Module

The global map module can take multiple types of data to plot as long as the data table is set up right. Make sure you have a column called **type** that lists the categories of data you want to plot. See how the `mar_global_map` was created in **dataprep/mar.R**.

```
## Mariculture Global Map ##
  callModule(card_map, "mar_global_map",
             data = mar_global_map,
             field = "input",
             filter_field = type, # type of data to plot
             display_field = "map_data",
             display_units = "units",
             color_palette = ygb,
             legend_title = "Legend",
             popup_title = "country")
```


---

## Set-up of the data table

The wrangling of the mariculture data was done in **dataprep/mar.R**. Create a new script for each new goal. 

Test `leaflet` map code in **test/test_global_map.Rmd**.

```
&gt; head(mar_global_map, 15)
# A tibble: 15 x 6
   rgn_id country           type     map_data units Taxon

## UI Module

* `select_type` options are **radio**, **drop_down**, **select**, or **search**
* `select_location` options are **below** or **above**
* `select_choices` is a vector of values that you want the user to be able to selet from (e.g. list of countries)

```
card_ui(id = "mar_prod",
        title_text = "Tonnes of Species Harvested by Country",
        sub_title_text = "Start exploring! Select or type in a country of interest. Click on names of species you want to remove from the plot. Hover over the points to view tonnes and species harvested.",
        select_type = "search",
        select_location = "above",
        select_choices = unique(mar_harvest$country),
        select_label = NULL,
        source_text = list(
                      p("Sources:"),
                      p(tags$sup("1."), tags$a(href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en", "Food and Agriculture Organization"), ", Global Aquaculture Production Quantity (March 2018)"))
                     )
```
---

## Server Module

This is the module that creates plots. The current options for plots include: bar graph, line graph, or scatterplot. This can be customized in the **modules** folder.

* `df` is the name of the wrangled data table
* `filter_field` is the column that gets filtered when the user is selecting different options. Should match with `select_choices`
* `colors` is a set color palette defined in **global.R**
* For a **bar chart**, set `plot_type` to **"bar"**, for a **line graph**, set `mode` to **"lines+markers"**, and for a **scatter**, set `mode` to **"markers"**

```
## Mariculture Production ##
  callModule(card_plot, "mar_prod",
             df = mar_harvest,
             x = "year",
             y = "tonnes",
             color_group = "species",
             filter_field = "country",
             colors = cols,
             plot_type = "scatter",
             mode = "lines+markers",
             tooltip_text = ~paste("Tonnes:", tonnes,
                                   "&lt;br&gt;Species:", species, sep=" "),
             xaxis_label = "Year",
             yaxis_label = "Annual Production (tonnes)")
```
